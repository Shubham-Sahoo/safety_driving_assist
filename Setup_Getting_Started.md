# SETUP AND GETTING STARTED GUIDE

## dlib library [![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/davisking/dlib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davisking/dlib)
Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. See [http://dlib.net](http://dlib.net) for the main project documentation and API reference.
We are using the python for coding on **PYNQ** board. Hence dlib's python API is installed.

## Compiling dlib Python API
Before you can run the Python example programs you must compile dlib. Type:
```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Controller Area Network(CAN) Protocol 
### Now we are fully equiped to understand and implement our code.
