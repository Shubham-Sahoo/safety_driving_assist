This keeps maintains an Attention Score based on Blinking Rate and Yawning of Driver, based on which it Warns him takes control of the vehicle if Attention score fall below certain level using CAN protocol to control Vehicle autonomously. 


#DLIB


# dlib C++ library [![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/davisking/dlib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davisking/dlib)

Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. See [http://dlib.net](http://dlib.net) for the main project documentation and API reference.

We are using the python for coding on **PYNQ** board. Hence dlib's python API is installed.


## Compiling dlib Python API

Before you can run the Python example programs you must compile dlib. Type:

```bash
python setup.py install
```


# CAN Protocol 
###  KVASER installation [Link](https://www.kvaser.com/linux-drivers-and-sdk/)

### CANLib installation [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz-lIVIU7ys&feature=youtu.be)
 

#### Now we are fully equiped to understand and implement our code.
